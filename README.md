---

TypeScript is a statically-typed programming language that is a superset of JavaScript.
It was developed and is maintained by Microsoft. TypeScript was created to address the challenges
of building large-scale JavaScript applications and adds optional type annotations, classes,
interfaces, and other features to the language.

The main benefits of using TypeScript include:

- Type Safety
- Improved Tooling
- Improved Maintainability
- Backwards Compatibility

| Topic                   | Subtopics | Description                                                                                                                                                | Issue   |
| ----------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Introduction            | 9         | [Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/)                                                                                                  | [#1]()  |
| Types                   | 4         | TypeScript has several built-in types, you can also create custom types using interfaces, classes, and type aliases.                                       | [#2]()  |
| Type Inference          | -         | Type inference refers to the process of automatically determining the type of a variable based on the value assigned to it.                                | [#3]()  |
| Type Compatibility      | -         | TypeScript uses structural typing to determine type compatibility.                                                                                         | [#4]()  |
| Combining Types         | 4         | In TypeScript, you can combine types using type union and type intersection.                                                                               | [#5]()  |
| Type Guards / Narrowing | 5         | Type guards are a way to narrow down the type of a variable.                                                                                               | [#6]()  |
| Functions               | 2         | Functions are a core building block in TypeScript.                                                                                                         | [#7]()  |
| Interfaces              | 4         | Interfaces in TypeScript provide a way to define a contract for a type, which includes a set of properties, methods, and events.                           | [#8]()  |
| Classes                 | 6         | Classes in TypeScript are a blueprint for creating objects (instances of a class), providing a way to structure objects and encapsulate data and behavior. | [#9]()  |
| Generics                | 2         | Generics in TypeScript are a way to write code that can work with multiple data types, instead of being limited to a single data type.                     | [#10]() |
| Decorators              | -         | Decorators are a feature of TypeScript that allow you to modify the behavior of a class, property, method, or parameter.                                   | [#11]() |
| Utility Types           | 12        | TypeScript provides several utility types that can be used to manipulate and transform existing types.                                                     | [#12]() |
| Advanced Types          | 5         | Advanced types in TypeScript are a set of advanced type constructs that allow for more complex and expressive type systems.                                | [#13]() |
| Modules                 | 5         | In TypeScript, modules are used to organize and reuse code.                                                                                                | [#14]() |

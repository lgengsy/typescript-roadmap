TypeScript is a statically-typed programming language that is a superset of JavaScript.
It was developed and is maintained by Microsoft. 

The main benefits of using TypeScript include:

- Type Safety
- Improved Tooling
- Improved Maintainability
- Backwards Compatibility


TypeScript was created to address the challenges
of building large-scale JavaScript applications and adds optional type annotations, classes,
interfaces, and other features to the language.
